# GRADLE WRAPPER ERROR - SOLUTION

You're getting this error:
```
Error: Could not find or load main class org.gradle.wrapper.GradleWrapperMain
```

This means the `gradle-wrapper.jar` file is missing or incomplete.

## Solution 1: Use the Automated Build Script (EASIEST)

I've included `build-mod.bat` which handles everything automatically:

1. **Double-click `build-mod.bat`** in Windows Explorer
2. It will automatically download Gradle and build your mod
3. Wait for it to complete (10-20 minutes total)
4. Your mod will be in `build\libs\autoclicker-1.0.0.jar`

## Solution 2: Fix the Gradle Wrapper

1. **Double-click `fix-gradle-wrapper.bat`**
2. It will download the missing gradle-wrapper.jar file
3. Then run: `.\gradlew setupDecompWorkspace`

## Solution 3: Manual Gradle Download

If the scripts don't work (firewall/antivirus blocking):

1. **Download Gradle 2.14 manually:**
   - Go to: https://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-2.14-bin.zip
   - Download and extract to a folder (like `C:\gradle-2.14`)

2. **Build using the full path:**
   ```
   C:\gradle-2.14\bin\gradle setupDecompWorkspace
   C:\gradle-2.14\bin\gradle build
   ```

## Solution 4: Download the Wrapper File Manually

1. **Download gradle-wrapper.jar:**
   - Go to: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gradle/gradle/v2.14.0/gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.jar
   - Save it to: `gradle\wrapper\gradle-wrapper.jar` (in your mod folder)

2. **Then run:**
   ```
   .\gradlew setupDecompWorkspace
   ```

## Which Solution Should You Use?

**→ Try Solution 1 first (build-mod.bat) - it's the easiest!**

If that doesn't work due to firewall/antivirus:
- Try Solution 2 (fix-gradle-wrapper.bat)
- Or use Solution 3 (manual download)

## Common Issues

**"Access Denied" or "Cannot download"**
- Your antivirus or firewall is blocking the download
- Temporarily disable it, or use Solution 3 (manual download)

**"Java not found"**
- Make sure Java 8 is installed
- Check with: `java -version`

**Still having issues?**
- Make sure you're in the correct folder (`autoclicker` folder)
- Check that you have internet connection
- Try running PowerShell or Command Prompt as Administrator

## Quick Test

To verify Java is working:
```
java -version
```

You should see something like:
```
java version "1.8.0_xxx"
```

If you don't see version 1.8, you need to install Java 8!

**TIP:** The easiest way is to just double-click `build-mod.bat` and let it handle everything!
