# BUILD YOUR MOD AUTOMATICALLY WITH GITHUB (FREE)

This is the EASIEST way to build your mod - let GitHub do it for you!

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Create a GitHub Account (Free)
Go to https://github.com and sign up (it's free!)

### 2. Create a New Repository
- Click the "+" button in the top right
- Select "New repository"
- Name it: `minecraft-autoclicker`
- Make it Public (required for free Actions)
- Don't add README, .gitignore, or license
- Click "Create repository"

### 3. Upload Your Files
On the repository page, you'll see "uploading an existing file"

**Drag and drop ALL these files/folders:**
- `.github` folder (with workflows inside)
- `src` folder
- `gradle` folder  
- `build.gradle`
- `gradlew`
- `gradlew.bat`
- All other files

OR use the command line if you know Git:
```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/minecraft-autoclicker.git
git push -u origin main
```

### 4. GitHub Will Automatically Build It!
- Go to the "Actions" tab in your repository
- You'll see a workflow running
- Wait 10-15 minutes for it to complete
- It will show a green checkmark when done

### 5. Download Your Mod
- Click on the completed workflow run
- Scroll down to "Artifacts"
- Download "AutoClicker-Mod"
- Inside the ZIP will be your `autoclicker-1.0.0.jar`!

## That's It!

GitHub's servers will build the mod for you with the correct Java version and memory settings. No more dealing with local build issues!

## Troubleshooting

**"Actions" tab doesn't show anything?**
- Make sure the repository is Public (not Private)
- Check that you uploaded the `.github` folder with the `workflows` folder inside it

**Build failed on GitHub?**
- Click on the failed run to see the error
- Usually it's a missing file - make sure you uploaded everything

**Can't find the Artifacts?**
- Scroll all the way down on the completed workflow run page
- The "Artifacts" section is at the bottom

## Why This Works Better

- ✅ Uses correct Java version (8)
- ✅ Plenty of memory allocated
- ✅ No local configuration needed
- ✅ Build logs show exactly what went wrong if there's an issue
- ✅ You can rebuild anytime by clicking "Re-run workflow"

**IMPORTANT:** Make sure you upload the entire folder structure, especially the `.github/workflows/` folder with the `build.yml` file inside it!
